# PC to HDD Backup

This script is used to back up files from PC to a External HDD.

This is done by copying the files from each location listed on the PC, over to the external HDD.

* Documents
* Pictures
* Music
* Videos
* Software

Once this process starts, this will go in order of the script, and will move onto the next folder once the previous one is complete.
